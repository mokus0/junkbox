-- on input, (a,c) are prev bracket, b is new guess.
-- on output, b and c bracket the root and |f(b)| <= |f(c)|
-- and 'a' is either the prev guess or one of the new endpoints
-- if f(a) is outside the range [f(b), f(c)].

-- Basically, this ensures that the algorithm always tightens either the
-- bound on the domain or the bound on the range, and never loosens the bound
-- on the domain.  In rare cases, a midpoint step (but not an inverse-quadratic 
-- step) can loosen the bound on the range, if I understand correctly.

-- between fa and fc or b is already between a and c (depending which kind of 
-- step was taken).  In the latter case, discard C and use A in its place, because
