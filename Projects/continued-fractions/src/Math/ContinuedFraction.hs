-- * The 'CF' type and basic operations

-- I think I would like to try refactoring this stuff at some point to use
-- an "Inductive" CF type, something like:
-- 
-- > data CF a
-- >     = CFZero               -- eval CFZero          = 0
-- >     | CFAdd    a (CF a)    -- eval (CFAdd    b x) =      b + eval x
-- >     | CFCont a a (CF a)    -- eval (CFCont a b x) = a / (b + eval x)

-- |A continued fraction.  Constructed by 'cf' or 'gcf'.
data CF a 
    = CF a [a]
    -- ^ Not exported. See 'cf', the public constructor.
    | GCF a [(a,a)]
    -- ^ Not exported. See 'gcf', the public constructor.

-- |Construct a continued fraction from its first term and the 
-- partial denominators in its canonical form, which is the form 
-- where all the partial numerators are 1.

-- @cf a [b,c,d]@ corresponds to @a + (b / (1 + (c / (1 + d))))@,
-- or to @GCF a [(1,b),(1,c),(1,d)]@.
